<h1>Hack-My-Hats</h1>
This repository contains various Hack-My-Hat challenges, AKA "Hats". Each is
designed to be run via the Tophat server (which this repository is a
submodule of). Note that none of the challenges located here are meant to be
run outside of Tophat and explicitly depend on it's API interface to function.
Furthermore, each challenge is run within a Docker container to enforce
secure encapsulation.
